# Java Springboot Demo Project

The primary goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-understand example of creating a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot, with a MySQL database as the data store. The project demonstrates how to set up the project, create API endpoints, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and manage dependencies using Maven.
